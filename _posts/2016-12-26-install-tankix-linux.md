# How to install TankiX on Linux!

--------------

Howdy, guyz!

Today, I’m back with a guide on how to install TankiX on Linux! [Preferably ubuntu]

---------------

### Okie-Dokie, so what do I need?

-------------

Umm… well, you’ll be needing ;

 - A Linux box
 - Wine
 - Winetricks
 - TankiX Windows installer
 
----------------
 
### The installation part…

----------------

First, open your Terminal by going to the dash or pressing ctrl+alt+T. Type in,

 - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wine/wine-builds

This will require your Root password, so have it handy. Press enter when you are prompted to do so. Then type in,

 - sudo apt-get install wine-devel

Press enter, and press y when prompted to do so. Remember, currently, as.of the date I am writing this article, only the Development version of Wine works with the TankiX installer.

After the installation finishes, go to the exe Windows installer for TankiX. Right click on it, click on other programs, and browse and click on winebrowser. The reason why we are using winebrowser instead of wine program loader is coz TankiX is rather internet dependent, and winebrowser gives you a additional boost for internet functions.

The installer for TankiX will run fine, and a new program by the name of TankiX will be in your Dash!

K, Bye for now, and don’t forget, I’ll be back!

PS : There might be a issue with the full screen option, so set the resolution to maximum and change it to windowed mode. This also increases performance for some reason…

PPS : I will add pictures soon, just wait for it!
